### Description:

>Her Feet upon the Dashboard
>is her feeling of Freedom

‚Äï Magie

<br/>

*This is a project focused on learning API calls that I did as part of the [Scrimba Front-End Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).  It takes the format of a chrome extension which upon opening a new tab makes an organizational dashboard.  It includes API calls to unsplash for the background, 
navigator to get latitude and longitude, the OpenWeatherMap API for the current weather conditions, and it also gets the current time and has a hidden pomodorro timer for those who look üòâüòâüòâ.*

### CHALLENGES I OVERCAME...
The course was beneficial for understanding the theory of HTTP requests, URLs, endpoints, parameters, promises, callbacks and much more. However, when creating my project, I encountered several challenges that were not covered in the course material.  This afforded me the opportunity to research through various forms of documentation including MDN, stackoverflow, and the API documentation.  I eventually resolved such issues:


- [X] Securing API keys: Placing the API key in a .env file at the root directory.

- [X] Version Control Issues: Using .gitignore to exclude sensitive files and commands like git filter-branch for cleaning the commit history.

- [X] Backend Service Setup: Setting up a backend using Node, Express.js, Axios, and dotenv.

- [X] Rate Limiting: Implementing 'express-rate-limit' for API calls.

- [X] Server & API Calls: Understanding the distinction between front-end and back-end servers, and the correct way to formulate and test API calls.

### MY OWN PERSONAL CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDED 

- [X] Developed a backend server to protect API keys
      
- [X] Utilized .env file, API key, .gitignore file

- [X] Introduced parameterized insertion

- [X] Designed a lookup table using new Map() for UI enhancements

- [X] Implemented a rate limiter for API security

- [X] Split out client-side from server side code.

- [X] Addressed CORS issues

- [X] Setup server in production environment
