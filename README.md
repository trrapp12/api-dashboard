### Description:

>Her Feet upon the Dashboard
>is her feeling of Freedom
>

― Magie

This is a project focused on learning API calls.  It takes the format of a chrome extension which upon opening a new tab makes an organizational dashboard.  It includes API calls to unsplash for the background, 
navigator to get latitude and longitude, the OpenWeatherMap API for the current weather conditions, and it also gets the current time and has a hidden pomodorro timer for those who look 😉😉😉.
