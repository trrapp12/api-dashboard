### Description:

>Her Feet upon the Dashboard
>is her feeling of Freedom
>

‚Äï Magie

This is a project focused on learning API calls that I did as part of the [Scrimba Front-End Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).  It takes the format of a chrome extension which upon opening a new tab makes an organizational dashboard.  It includes API calls to unsplash for the background, 
navigator to get latitude and longitude, the OpenWeatherMap API for the current weather conditions, and it also gets the current time and has a hidden pomodorro timer for those who look üòâüòâüòâ.

### QUICKSTART GUIDE: 

Click on the "View Project" button above ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

---

### Project demonstrates the following:

- [X] API calls
    
- [X] Fetch method

- [X] Promise chaining with .then()
    
- [X] 'async/await'
    
- [X] Response parsing

---

### CHALLENGES I OVERCAME...
The course was beneficial for understanding the theory of HTTP requests, URLs, endpoints, parameters, promises, callbacks and much more. However, when creating my project, I encountered several challenges that were not covered, including:


- [X] Securing API keys: Placing the API key in a .env file at the root directory.

- [X] Version Control Issues: Using .gitignore to exclude sensitive files and commands like git filter-branch for cleaning the commit history.

- [X] Backend Service Setup: Setting up a backend using Node, Express.js, Axios, and dotenv.

- [X] Rate Limiting: Implementing 'express-rate-limit' for API calls.

- [X] Server & API Calls: Understanding the distinction between front-end and back-end servers, and the correct way to formulate and test API calls.

---

### MY OWN PERSONAL CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDED 

- [X] Learning how to, creating, and using a backend server to serve up my request without endangering my API Key
      
- [X] use of .env File, API key, .gitignore file

- [X] parameterized insertion instead of inline insertion

- [X] Use of new Map() to create a lookup table to insert my own, better UI elements than what the API offers

- [X] Creating a rate limiter to prevent abuse of my API key

- [X] splitting out client-side from server side code.

- [X] finding solutions for CORS issues

### ATTRIBUTIONS

* Icons from [Orion Icon Library](orioniconlibrary.com).

* This project was inspired by the [Personal Dashboard](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend/section-intro-co474451c9456715dcac4b188) project from the [Scrimba Front-End Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).  The majority of the work is consistent with what was presented in the original project, with additiions and variations noted in the personal contributions section.
